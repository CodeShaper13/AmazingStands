# AmazingStands
A Minecraft Forge mod that adds on to Armor Stands.

The vanilla items are used to interact with the Armor Stands.  When using items, make sure you both sneak and the attack key (defaults to left click). Don't worry, as long as you're sneaking, you won't break anything.

### Empty Hand:
  Switch the items in the Armor Stands hands, flipping the one from the right hand, to the left hand, and then back again. Great for making your Armor Stand duel wield.

### Pickaxe:
  Remove base.

### Axe:
  Toggle the Armor Stand between big (normal) and small.

### Sticks:
  With two sticks you can add arms to your Armor Stand. Click again to remove them.

### Slabs:
  Click to make the slab into the new base.

### Skull:
  Transform the Armor Stand into a statue. Player, Creeper and Zombie heads and Skeleton and Wither Skeleton skulls work, transforming the Armor Stand into the respective mob type. Creepers sadly can't have armor.

### Slime Ball:
  Remove gravity, so the Armor Stand will float.

### Invisibility Potion:
  Make the Armor Stand invisible. Armor and held items will still show up.

### Milk Bucket:
  Remove both the no gravity and invisibility effect.
